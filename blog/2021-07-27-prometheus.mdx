_Sometimes the only way to get what you need is to do it yourself._

Software is becoming more and more necessary in our work; if you are involved in BIM, you know this well.

🤯
In addition to BIM architect, I am also a programmer. I decided to try out a new programming tool: [WebStorm by JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). My surprise was to discover its price: around **100 euros/license year**.

💰
In contrast, some of the most popular BIM tools cost around **2500 euros/license year**. On top of that, they use proprietary formats, which means that the day you decide to stop using them, you lose access to all your work.

👨‍💼👨‍💼👨‍💼
This is what happens when only a few have access to a resource that we all need; in this case, that resource is the **ability to create BIM software**. We can write all the [letters of complaint](https://gfxspeak.com/2020/08/04/architects-demand-autodesk/) we want, but the fact is that these software houses will keep doing what they do as long as we keep paying them.

<IfcCard>
  💸 Some BIM tools are around <b>25</b> times more expensive than software development tools.

💪
But that can change. Now, for the first time, we have the opportunity to bring BIM back to the industry. A BIM that is affordable, effective and that suits our needs: **a BIM made by us and for us**.

🤝
Maybe you think it's a bit utopian to think that we can stand up to the big commercial BIM houses with open source. However, don't forget that we are the source of money that keeps those big companies alive, and initiatives like [IFC.js](https://ifcjs.github.io/info/), [Speckle](https://speckle.systems/), [BlenderBIM](https://blenderbim.org/) and [OSArch](https://osarch.org/) keep growing every day.

🚀
At the end of the day, you can keep wishing for a better industry while letting big companies take your money, or you can [contribute](https://discord.gg/FXfyR4XrKT) to create it. Sometimes, the only way to get what you need is to do it yourself.
