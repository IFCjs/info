You may have heard about **IFC.js** in recent months. If you are not familiar with the world of software development and BIM, you may be wondering what it is all about.

üè†
**BIM** (Building Information Modelling) is the new way of working in the construction industry. Instead of drawing plans, three-dimensional models containing the geometry of the building and its information are used. It is very similar to the buildings in [The SIMS](https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims); it saves a lot of money and allows teams to work more efficiently.

üí∏
However, there is a problem: developing BIM applications is not accesible to everyone, mainly because the necessary technology (**IFC**) is very expensive to implement. This means that until now only a small group of large commercial software houses have had access to the BIM ecosystem.

We believe it's **not fair**. And not only is this not fair to developers who are left out of the market, but it is not fair to customers, who are victims of the predatory pricing of an oligopolistic market. That is why this project exists.

  ü§ù Our goal is to enable <b>anyone</b> to create BIM applications.

Who are we? A group of developers who want to improve the construction industry in their spare time. The project started in 2021 with [Tom](https://github.com/tomvandig), [Harry](https://github.com/harrycollin) and me and has been growing ever since, with more and more people and companies willing to change the situation in the sector and commit to a **real open BIM**.

It doesn't matter if you are a developer, architect, engineer or something else. If you too want to improve the industry, [join us](https://discord.gg/FXfyR4XrKT) and help us make a difference.
