["## Understanding IFC.js\n","üêüüê†üê°\r\nIFC.js is not just a library: it is an ecosystem of libraries and projects that make creating BIM tools trivial. There are two reasons for this modularity:\n","*   To be able to use in our applications only what we need.\n*   To make the library more maintainable.\n","It is important to understand which pieces make it up in order to know what to use in each case. IFC.js is essentially composed of 3 layers, each with a unique responsibility.\n","web-ifc","<div style={{margin: \"1rem 0\"}}>\n  An IFC file parser. It is able to read all information from an IFC, edit it and write new files. It has no 3d viewer, it only works with data.\n</div>\n","<div style={{margin: \"1rem 0\"}} />\n","<div>\n  <b>When to use:</b>\n</div>\n","<div style={{margin: \"1rem 0\"}}>\n  When you want to read or write IFC files without any viewer.
