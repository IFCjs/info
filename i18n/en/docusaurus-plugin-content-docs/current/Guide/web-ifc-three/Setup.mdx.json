["## ðŸŒµ DRY documentation ðŸŒµ\n","We don't want to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself\">repeat ourselves</a>; not even in our documentation.\n","ðŸ‘€\r\nThe setup for starting a project with web-ifc has already been seen in <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Hello%20world\">Hello World</a>. If you have skipped that point, we recommend you to go and have a look at it. All tutorials will start from that scene.\n","You are free to follow these tutorials using the Three.js IFCLoader instead.\n","ðŸ˜Š\r\nIf you get lost in any of the tutorials, don't worry! Take a look at the examples [here](https://github.com/IFCjs/hello-world) or come to the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/g7Uzn2KSwB) and ask us directly. Also, let us know of any suggestions so we can improve these docs.\n","Before going forward","Basic knowledge of Three.js and web development is assumed. If you don't have\r\nthis background, we recommend that you start{\" \"}\r\n<a href=\"https://threejs.org/manual/\">here</a> before jumping into IFC.js.\n"]
