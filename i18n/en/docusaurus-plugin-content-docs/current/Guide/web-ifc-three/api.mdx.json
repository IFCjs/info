["## The list of awesome things you can do with web-ifc-three\n","üìÉ\r\nAll APIs are documented, so when you use any of the objects or methods seen in this documentation, you should see help in Intellisense, regardless of the IDE you are using. [Check it out!](https://github.com/IFCjs/web-ifc-three/blob/main/web-ifc-three/src/IFC/components/IFCManager.ts)\n","üë©‚Äçüè´\r\nHowever, we realise that reading intellisense or comments is not the most comfortable thing to do, so on this page we will make an overview of what the API can do. Everything will be covered in more detail in specific tutorials later on.\n","## IfcLoader\n","üíé\r\nThe only object we will import from the library. It contains all the logic needed to work with IFC. You can use its `load()` and `loadAsync()` methods to load IFCs from a URL, [just like any other Three.js Loader](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/loaders/Loader.load). For example, to load an IFC we can do the following:\n","üè†üè†üè†\r\nWith `web-ifc-three` you can load multiple models in the scene. Many of the API operations are executed on a specified model. To express on which model we want to operate we have to give its `ModelID`.\n","üîç\r\nYou can get the ID of a model through the property `modelID`.\n","‚úå\r\nThere are two ways to access the API:\n","*   Through the instances of `IfcModel` that the `IfcLoader` generates with `load` and `loadAsync`.\n\n*   Through `IfcLoader.IfcManager`.\n","Both <b>IfcModel</b> instances and <b>IfcLoader.IfcManager</b> can be used\r\ninterchangeably to access the API. There's one difference: when using{\" \"}\r\n<b>IfcModel</b>, the ModelID never has to be given as an argument (it's known\r\nimplicitly).\n","## üß∞ Setup\n","### setWasmPath\n","üß†\r\nSpecifies the location of the `web-ifc.wasm` and `web-ifc-mt.wasm` files. These files are the web-ifc file and is required to create any application with IFC.js. You can find them in `node_modules/web-ifc/`.\n","Careful with your tooling!","If you use frameworks or libraries like React, Angular, Vue or Svelte it is\r\npossible that the root path of the project doesn't correspond to the root path\r\nof the served application. You will have to check in{\" \"}\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/IFCjs/examples\">each case</a> how the paths of the\r\nstatically served files are managed.\n","#### Arguments:\n","*   `path` Route of `web-ifc.wasm`.\n","#### Example:\n","If `web-ifc.wasm` is in dist/wasmDir:\n","### setupThreeMeshBVH\n","‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°\r\nThis method allows object picking to be much faster, especially for very large models with heavy geometry. This method actually allows IFC.js to use the Garrett Johnson's amazing [library ](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh). u can install it with `npm i three-mesh-bvh` or `yarn add three-mesh-bvh`.\n","‚òù Using this method not mandatory, but if you want to be able to select\r\nobjects in medium / large IFC models at 60 fps, it's necessary.\n","#### Arguments:\n","*   `computeBoundsTree` Pre-made BufferGeometry extension function that builds a new BVH, assigns it to boundsTree, and applies the new index buffer to the geometry. - [source](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh#computeboundstree).\n\n*   `disposeBoundsTree` BufferGeometry extension function that disposes of the BVH. - [source](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh#disposeboundstree).\n\n*   `acceleratedRaycast` Accelerated raycast function with the same signature as THREE.Mesh.raycast. Uses the BVH for raycasting if it's available otherwise it falls back to the built-in approach. - [source](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh#acceleratedraycast).\n","#### Example:\n","### setOnProgress\n","‚è≥\r\nSets a callback function that is called every 10% of IFC loaded. This way, you can display a loading bar to show your user how the loading is going.\n","#### Arguments:\n","*   `onProgress`: Callback function that is called every 10%. That function must have one argument that that receives an object with two properties: `loaded` (number of objects loaded) and `total` (number of objects in the file).\n","#### Example:\n","### applyWebIfcConfig\n","üéπüéπüéπ\r\nApplies a configuration for [web-ifc](https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Guide/web-ifc/Introduction), which is the parser that this library uses internally.\n","#### Arguments:\n","*   `settings`: An object containing the following fields:\n\n*   `COORDINATE_TO_ORIGIN: boolean`: Wether to bring the model to the center of the scene. Useful for geolocated models.\n\n*   `USE_FAST_BOOLS: boolean`: Wether to use a faster (and less precise) boolean logic.\n\n*   `BOOL_ABORT_THRESHOLD?: number`: The limit to the boolean operation computation.\n\n*   `CIRCLE_SEGMENTS_LOW?: number`: The resolution for low segments curves.\n\n*   `CIRCLE_SEGMENTS_MEDIUM?: number`: The resolution for medium segments curves (e.g. IfcSweptDiskSolid).\n\n*   `CIRCLE_SEGMENTS_HIGH?: number`: The resolution for high segments curves (e.g. IfcCircle).\n","#### Example:\n","If a file is geolocated and we want to bring it to the origin of the scene:\n","### useWebworkers\n","üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\r\nToggles the web worker that contains the parsing logic. The rest of the API remains the same, but all the logic will happen in another thread of the machine, so the app will never be blocked by heavy operations.\n","üöß You need to copy the file `IFCWorker.js` to your project and pass the relative path as a second argument.\n","#### Arguments:\n","*   `active`: Wether to use web workers or not.\n*   `path`: Relative path to the worker file. Necessary if `active = true`.\n","#### Example:\n","If the file `IFCWorker.js` is in a folder called: `files`:\n","### useJSONData\n","üöÄ\r\nUses JSON property data instead of the WASM data, which consumes much less memory. Only use this in the following scenarios:\n","*   If you don't need to access the properties of the IFC\n*   If you will provide the properties as JSON.\r\n    You can get the JSON from an IFC file in advance following [this example](https://github.com/IFCjs/hello-world/tree/main/examples/web-ifc/ifc-to-json/node).\n","#### Arguments:\n","*   `useJSON`: Wether to use JSON data or not.\n","#### Example:\n","### addModelJSONData\n","üì¶üì¶üì¶\r\nAdds the properties of a model as JSON data. If you are using web workers, use `loadJsonDataFromWorker()` instead to avoid overheads.\n","#### Arguments:\n","*   `modelID`: ID of the IFC model.\n*   `data`: data as an object where the keys are the expressIDs and the values the properties. In addition, each value has the properties `expressID` (id of the item) and `type` (IFC class of the item).\n","#### Example:\n","### loadJsonDataFromWorker\n","üì¶üì¶üì¶\r\nLoads the data of an IFC model from a JSON file directly from a web worker. If you are not using web workers, use `addModelJSONData()` instead.\n","#### Arguments:\n","*   `modelID`: ID of the IFC model.\n*   `path`: the path to the JSON file **relative to the web worker file**.\n","#### Example:\n","## üîç Getters\n","### getExpressId\n","üí≥\r\nGets the Express ID of an IFC element from a face index.\n","Why a face index?","Because when we select an object in 3d space with the mouse we get the index\r\nof that face. We usually want the ID of the object where that face belongs to\r\nin order to highlight it, isolate it or get all its properties.\n","#### Arguments:\n","*   `geometry` [Geometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/BufferGeometry) of the model you clicked on with the mouse.\n\n*   `faceIndex` Index of the face intersected with the [raycaster](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Raycaster). If you are not familiar with the raycaster, don't worry; we'll cover this in detail in the tutorial about picking.\n","#### Example:\n","### getIfcType\n","üé∏ü™ïüéª\r\nGets the IFC type of the specified element (e.g. IFCWALL).\n","Elements in IFC always have an associated type: IfcWall, IfcSlab, IfcWindow,\r\nIfcDoor, etc.\n","#### Arguments:\n","*   `modelID` ID of the IFC model.\n\n*   `id` Express ID of the item whose properties to obtain.
