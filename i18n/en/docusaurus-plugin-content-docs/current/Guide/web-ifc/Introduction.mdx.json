["## Full IFC control at native speed\n","🌎\r\nIt is often thought that web applications are not as powerful as desktop applications. Relatively recently, however, [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) appeared on the scene.\n","WebAssembly is a technology that allows the use of languages like C++ to\r\ncreate web applications.\n","🔥🔥🔥\r\nThis means we can have the best of both worlds: the **flexibility** of a web application and the **full performance** of a machine. And this is what web-ifc is all about. You can install it with `npm i web-ifc` or `yarn add web-ifc` and it has the following features:\n","⚡ It is as <b>fast</b> as native applications thanks to its parsing core,\r\nwritten from scratch in C++.\n","🚀 It can be run directly on the <b>client</b> or as a <b>backend service</b>.\r\nBring BIM to all parts of your system!\n","📚 It can read <b>100% of the IFC data, including IFC types</b>. This allows\r\ndata to be easily extracted, structured, traversed and entered into databases.\n","🌈 It can <b>edit data and write entire IFCs from scratch</b>. Create apps\r\nthat communicate with the large software vendors.\n","In the following points, the API and its functionalities will be shown step by step. However, there are a <b>some issues</b> that are important to be clear about before using `web-ifc`.\n","### But wait, I don't know C++!\n","👌\r\nDon't worry! Although the parser is written in C++, it is compiled in a file called `web-ifc.wasm` that **browsers understand automatically**. Just include this file in your application and you will have access to the full API with native speed with **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**. How cool is that?\n","### What is the .wasm file for?\n","🧠\r\nThe web-ifc.wasm file contains the IFC **parsing core**. It is pre-compiled and **hyper-efficient**; unlike JavaScript, which has to be compiled line by line, this file can be sent directly to the CPU and executed without prior interpretation.\n","📦\r\nYou can find this file in the `node-modules/web-ifc/web-ifc.wasm` folder. You will need to serve this file with your application (if frontend) or have it on your server (if backend).\n","Beware: when you update the web-ifc version in your application, you will also\r\nhave to update (copy) the corresponding version of web-ifc.wasm .\n","### When should I use web-ifc?\n","🦅\r\n`Web-ifc` is the **lightest** and **most flexible** module of IFC.js. However, this flexibility also means that you have to know what you are doing, and therefore know the internals of the IFC schema relatively well.\n","☝\r\nMoreover, web-ifc **does not implement a 3d viewer**. This is an advantage, because it means that you can get IFC geometry without relying on a particular 3d renderer in a more agile way.\n","If you want to see 3d geometry easily, you will either have to implement it\r\nyourself, or use <b>web-ifc-three</b> or <b>web-ifc-viewer</b>.\n"]
