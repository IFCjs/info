["## Learn BIM development with us\n","🌱 Whether you **know nothing about programming** but you'd like to get started or you're an **experienced developer** but would like to take your BIM applications to the next level, we've got you covered!\n","<img src={require(\"@site/static/img/clipart/lesson.png\").default} alt=\"PC image\"></img>","🚀 We offer **BIM programming courses for all levels**. These courses include:\n","<IfcCard>📺 In-depth video lessons in english.</IfcCard>\n","<IfcCard>👩‍💻 Scripts of all the theory.</IfcCard>\n","<IfcCard>📋 All the code with comments.</IfcCard>\n","<IfcCard>👩‍🏫 Answers from the teachers.</IfcCard>\n","<IfcCard>🏆 Access to exclusive hackathons.</IfcCard>\n","<IfcCard>🎁 Exclusive IFC.js merchandising.</IfcCard>\n","## Why aren't these courses free?\n","🤝 **IFC.js is, and always will be, free for everyone.** However, in order to keep growing the project, we need funds to organize events, pay project expenses, reward the active community and much more. These courses are a way to get those funds.\n","🌈 **The money from the courses is reinvested entirely in the project.** You can see how we manage the funds in a totally transparent way at [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/ifcjs).\n","👨‍💻 **Would you like us to spend this money somewhere else?** You can join the project as [sponsor](https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Contribute) or [patreon](https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Contribute) and have a say in where we spend these funds.\n","## How much do they cost?\n","### For non-patreons\n","🧑 Each course costs **$100** for non-patreons. But that money doesn't go to us, it goes to the project. Therefore, to purchase a course you just need to [make a donation of $100 in open collective](https://opencollective.com/ifcjs) and send us the voucher, as well as the course (or courses) you want to get access to.\n","### For patreons\n","🧑🔥 Patreons can purchase courses at a great discount based on their patreon membership. Each uninterrupted month's stay in the patreon discounts all the courses by $15, up to a maximum of $25.\n","🎉 In other words, a community member who commits to stay in the patreon for 6 months can purchase **any course for $25**.\n","🏆 In addition, they will have **exclusive content** to which general users do not have access and the power to decide on the subject matter of the next courses.\n","💛 Of course, patreons also have [all other advantages included in the patreon tier](https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Patreon).\n","### For corporate patreons\n","👨‍💼💼 Corporate patreons have **free access to all courses for up to 50 employees**, as well as live webinars from the creators of the library to their development teams, prime support and all other benefits granted by the [corporate patreon](https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Patreon).\n","### Adaptative discount\n","🤝 We are aware that the world is diverse and not all countries have the same purchasing power. However, **we do not want to leave out people due to global economic reasons**. If the average salary in your country is less than $1000, you can apply the **adaptative discount**.\n","😊 This discount gives access to the courses and patreon tiers for a price equal to the **proportional difference between the average salary in your country and $1000**. For example, if the average salary is $800, you get a 20% discount. If the average salary is $400, the discount would be 60%.\n","## How do I know they're good?\n","🚀 No worries! The first lessons and notes are **free and open to anyone**, so you can try the quality of the rest of the material before paying anything.\n","## How do I enroll?\n","🚧 The courses are not ready yet! We are working really hard to make them happen as soon as possible. In the meantime, you can [become a patreon](https://opencollective.com/ifcjs) and get a great discount when they get out (as described above). We estimate that they will be released in **March/April**.\n","👌 Once they are released, make a donation to our [open-collective account](https://opencollective.com/ifcjs) and we will give you access to everything.\n"]
