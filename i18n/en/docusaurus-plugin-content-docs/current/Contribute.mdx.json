["## Work with us\n","👩‍💻 IFC.js is developed by many companies and individuals around the globe. Do you want to help us with the code and join our consortium? This is the page you were looking for.\n","If you are looking for a way to join our community and learn BIM and coding\r\nwith us, check out our{\" \"}\r\n<a href=\"https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Patreon\">patreon's page</a>!\n","🤷‍♀️️\r\nWe all want the same thing: to create our own BIM applications and do business. However, if we all develop applications from scratch, **we will never be able to compete with the industry giants**.\n","🤝\r\nSo we want to propose you to **join forces**.\n","👨‍💼\r\nIt's easy: anyone can use IFC.js commercially without any limitations. However, each BIM application is different, and it is likely that as you build your application, **you will create new cool BIM functionalities**.\n","🔥\r\nOf course, you could implement those features in your closed source application... or you could **implement them directly in IFC.js**.\n","### But wait, why on earth would I do that!?\n","<img src={require(\"@site/static/img/clipart/1.png\").default} alt=\"PC image\"></img>","💪💪💪\r\nIt is pointless to compete with each other for the scraps of the big BIM software companies. However, **if we join forces, we can make this a fair fight**.\n","<img src={require(\"@site/static/img/clipart/2.png\").default} alt=\"PC image\"></img>","🤖\r\nAlso, by doing so you would become a **code sponsor**. This grants you the following advantages:\n","Your needs go FIRST","We will implement everything you need from the library very quickly. Your\r\nneeds will have top priority over the rest.\n","Decision-making power","Do you think the library should go in a particular direction? You can decide!\r\nYou will have a say in the direction of the project.\n","Early access to new functionalities","You will be able to access new project functionalities before anyone else; a\r\ncompetitive advantage in your BIM app.\n","Access to exclusive chat for maintainers","You will have a direct line to us and you will be able to see how the project\r\nis cooked behind closed doors.\n","### What does it cost me?\n","👌\r\n**Absolutely nothing**, not even time. Simply put, instead of reserving all of your BIM code for yourself, you can leave some of it open in IFC.js.\n","It's simply a question of which repository you save your code to.\n","### Are there really any companies participating?\n","💼\r\nYes, and **some of them are worth millions**. If the programme is good enough for them, maybe it's good enough for your company.\n","💰💰💰\r\nThese companies are creating their own BIM software from scratch, tailor-made and **without paying anything at all**.\n","### Do you seriously think you can compete with the big BIM software companies?\n","🌈\r\nIn 2020 nobody thought you could create BIM applications in 50 lines of code; now, thanks to IFC.js, it's trivial. In one year, 3 people from different countries and companies have achieved that in our spare time.\n","🤝\r\nCan you imagine how much we could achieve **with your contribution?**\n","The thought that we cannot compete with them is a thought that only benefits\r\nthem. Are we going to admit that we have already lost before we try?\n","### But I know nothing about the project!\n","👩‍🏫\r\nDon't worry: if you want to participate, we will give **top priority to your onboarding** so that you can start using the library right away and help us with whatever you want.\n","### Do I have to share all my code?\n","🔑\r\nNo! **You can share only those parts that you want** and that can be interesting for the whole community. There is no minimum size to be a sponsor, so don't worry.\n","### What if I am an educational institution?\n","👩‍🏫\r\nGreat! If you decide to include IFC.js in your teaching programme, you can also be a sponsor. Contact us, and we will be at your disposal to train you, solve your and your students' doubts and help them to enter the world of Open BIM.\n","### How do I get started?\n","😊\r\n[Talk to us!](https://discord.gg/FXfyR4XrKT) Tell us about your situation and your ideas and we will help you get started as soon as possible.\n"]
