## What's this about?

🐞 Our projects are becoming more and more complex, and that means that it is often not possible to carry them out with the tools of a single brand. Open BIM is the solution to this problem; it is increasingly present in our workflows, and **IFC is its foundation**.

<IfcCard>IFC allows the exchange of information between applications of different vendors, as well as accessing the information without depending on a single application / licensing policy.</IfcCard>

🌈 However, documentation is not easy and it is often difficult to discern what is really important to know from this scheme. **In this course we are going to teach you all the knowledge we have needed to develop IFC.js.**

🌟 **This is not a programming course**, although at some point we might write some code to illustrate some of the concepts. Instead, this course aims to understand how the IFC schema works, what information does it contains and how is it structured.
