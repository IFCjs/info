## ðŸŒµ DRY documentation ðŸŒµ

We don't want to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">repeat ourselves</a>; not even in our documentation.

ðŸ‘€
The setup for starting a project with web-ifc has already been seen in <a target="_self" href="https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Hello%20world">Hello World</a>. If you have skipped that point, we recommend you to go and have a look at it. All tutorials will start from that scene.

<IfcAlert>You are free to follow these tutorials using the Three.js IFCLoader instead.</IfcAlert>

ðŸ˜Š
If you get lost in any of the tutorials, don't worry! Take a look at the examples [here](https://github.com/IFCjs/hello-world) or come to the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/g7Uzn2KSwB) and ask us directly. Also, let us know of any suggestions so we can improve these docs.

<IfcCard icon="ðŸš¦" title="Before going forward">
  Basic knowledge of Three.js and web development is assumed. If you don't have this background, we recommend that you start <a href="https://threejs.org/manual/">here</a> before jumping into IFC.js.
