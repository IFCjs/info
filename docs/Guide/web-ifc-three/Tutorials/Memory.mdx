## Introduction

📭📫
On many occasions we will want to create applications that are able to **open and close BIM viewers**. Although this may seem obvious, there is a problem: **memory management**.

🤔
Now many will be scratching their heads, since memory management is not a common issue in web applications. JavaScript and other modern languages have **automatic memory management / garbage collector**, so the programmer doesn't have to worry about freeing up objects and arrays.

✍🤖❓
However, when working with Three.js, data going to the graphics card (e.g. buffers) is **not affected by this automatic memory management**.

🤕
That means that if we close a viewer made with Three.js (with or without IFC.js), we will create a 💦 **memory leak** 💦. That is to say, we are blocking a part of the user's RAM memory. If the leak becomes too big, the application will become slower and slower and may **crash**.

🚀
This becomes especially critical if we are creating a **SPA** (**Single Page Application**), for example, using frameworks and libraries such as **React or **Angular\*\*. In these cases the web application is never reloaded, and the memory leak accumulates.

Fortunately, IFC.js has taken this into account and allows you to **release the used memory very easily**. Let's see how. 👇

## How to do it

### Monitoring the memory

👀
The first question you probably have if you haven't worked much with Three.js optimized scenes is **how to see how much memory your application consumes**. Otherwise, it is impossible to detect memory leaks.

🌍
There are several ways to do this. The first is to use the **developer tools** of the browser you are using. For example, in Google Chrome there is a section called "Memory" where you can take snapshots and see how much memory the current tab is consuming.

🤖
However, a more convenient way is to use the library [stats.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/). This library allows to **monitor the performance and memory** of a Three.js application. It can be installed with `npm i stats.js` and can be used as follows:

```js
// Stats
const stats = new Stats();
stats.showPanel(2);
document.body.append(stats.dom);

// Animation loop
const animate = () => {
  stats.begin();

  // Update other stuff
  stats.end();
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
};

animate();
```

📋
This will bring up the **scene statistics during execution**. By clicking on them we can toggle between performance and memory usage of the app.

### Dispose memory

✌
Now let's create a function that removes all the memory consumed by IFC.js. There are 2 things to keep in mind:

- If we have specified the **path to the WASM files** previously, we will have to do it again in the new instance of web-ifc-three.

- This one is important: if we have stored a reference to the loaded IFC models in an array, an object or a class, **we have to delete them manually**. Otherwise, the memory will not be freed.

```js
async function releaseMemory() {
  // This releases all IFCLoader memory
  await ifcLoader.ifcManager.dispose();
  ifcLoader = null;
  ifcLoader = new IFCLoader();

  // If the wasm path was set before, we need to reset it
  await ifcLoader.ifcManager.setWasmPath("../../../");

  // If IFC models are an array or object,
  // you must release them there as well
  // Otherwise, they won't be garbage collected
  models.length = 0;
}
```

### Set up simple GUI

💅
Finally, we are going to create an HTML button and link it to the function we created earlier.

```html
<input type="button" id="memory-button" value="Release memory" />
```

```js
// Sets up memory disposal
const button = document.getElementById("memory-button");
button.addEventListener(`click`, () => releaseMemory());
```

😎 This is how the application looks like:

<Scene link={"https://ifcjs.github.io/hello-world/examples/web-ifc-three/memory/index.html"} />

Try loading a model and releasing the memory: you'll see it go back to normal. Beware that **it can take some seconds**, as the browser garbage collector takes some time. Alternatively, you can manually apply the garbage collector using the browser's developer tools.

### SPA

🌈
It is very common to create **SPA** or **Single Page Applications** because they are more efficient and require less communication with the backend. Examples of tools to make these applications are **React**, **Angular**, **Vue**, etc.

👶👴
In many cases **these tools manage the lifecycle of the application components automatically**. For example, when the user closes the 3d view, the HTML element containing the view is automatically destroyed.

🚧🚧🚧
To avoid memory leaks, it will be necessary to **free the application memory as seen in this tutorial each time the component containing the 3D view is destroyed**. In many cases there are hooks or similar mechanisms to execute this logic automatically each time the component is destroyed.

## Next steps

🎉🎉🎉
Congratulations! You now know how to manage the memory of the BIM applications you create with IFC.js, so your applications will be 100% free of memory leaks.

💪
Next we are going to look at some advanced model loading tools, such as multithreading and load process event.
