## Introduction

🚶‍♀️ Now that you're able to load models into your scene, we can jump into functionalities that make `web-ifc-viewer` really shine 🌟. Here we'll learn to make our models a little more **interactive**, using **picking functions** from the IFC.js API.

## How to do it 

### Easy pickings

👩‍🏫 Let's start out by using our 🖱️ mouse to highlight different parts of our model when **hovered**. Thankfully IFC.js makes it easy with the built in method `prePickIfcItem()`. 

```js
window.onmousemove = () => viewer.IFC.selector.prePickIfcItem()
```

<IfcCard>
🙌 Under the hood web-ifc-viewer borrows the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=raycaster#api/en/core/Raycaster">Raycaster</a> from Three.js. And since IFC.js created the official <a href="https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_loader_ifc.html">IFCLoader</a> for Three.js, it's a beautiful marriage! 
</IfcCard>

### Preserve the pick

Now, let's use `pickIfcItem()` to preserve our selection and then **center our model** in the camera's view.  

```js
window.onclick = () => viewer.IFC.selector.pickIfcItem(true)
```
<IfcCard>
🧐 If you don't want to center the model, just leave the first argument of <i>pickIfcItem()</i> empty, which defaults to <i>false</i>.
</IfcCard>

If we go a step further and **destructure** the selection, we return information very useful in other IFC.js methods, such as `getProperties()`.

```js
window.onclick = async () => {
  const {modelID, id} = await viewer.IFC.selector.pickIfcItem(true);
    const props = await viewer.IFC.getProperties(modelID, id, true, false);
    console.log(props);
}
```

### Highlighting

What if we wanted to **isolate** a certain part of our model and 👻 hide the rest? This is where `highlightIfcItem()` comes in handy. We'll just attach it to the `ondblclick` event for now.

```js
window.ondblclick = viewer.IFC.selector.highlightIfcItem(true)
```

### Clear it up

🔙 Maybe we went a bit wild with our clicking and selecting. So let's call `unpickIfcItems()` and `unHighlightIfcItems()` to clear our doings with our `C` key ⌨️.

```js
window.onkeydown = (event) => {
    if(event.code === 'KeyC') {
        viewer.IFC.selector.unpickIfcItems();
        viewer.IFC.selector.unHighlightIfcItems();
    }
}
```
### Getting specific

🔍 In some situations, we may want to use our **Express ID's** to interact with the model in a different way. In this tutorial we'll add a simple button to let the user highlight a part of the model that isn't so easily visible. 

Let's quickly **add a button** with some styling 🎨.

```html 
<button id="express_22492">Front Door</button>
<!-- style to your preference  -->
```

🏷️ And finally specify our **Express ID** in the event handler 🖐️ with the `pickIfcItemsByID()` method,  

```js
document.getElementById('express_22492')
.addEventListener('click', () => {
    viewer.IFC.selector.pickIfcItemsByID(0, [22492], true);
})
```

🎉🎉🎉
Congrats! You now know how to **pick** and **highlight** your model in a handful of different ways. Now it's up to you to use the tools creatively in your own project!
